          Every time we step through a door, we transform into a different
          character. Doors are also metaphorically used as entrances to heaven
          and hell. Auguste Rodin’s “Porte de l’Enfer” is a well-known
          representation of the gates of hell.

          This visualization explores the endless cycle of doors we encounter
          throughout our lives and beyond. As we move through space, we
          continuously enter and exit different phases of existence—each doorway
          transforming who we are. Just as an infinite stairway progresses
          through these transitions, we progress from child to adult, student to
          professional, and so on—roles that shape our identity with each
          passage.
        </p>

          The alternating black and white scenes represent the duality of
          existence—life and death, light and dark, beginning and end. Yet, the
          loop never truly ends; it transforms into new beginnings. Through this
          endless corridor of doors, we witness how each transition shapes us,
          changes us, and leads us to our next transformation. The journey
          continues infinitely, reminding us that every end is simply another
          beginning.

A description of your Data Portrait. What was the personal habit you were trying to track?
I tracked my screen time for the past 7 days.

An instruction for the viewers on how to read your data portrait.
This data portrait is not supposed to be read. Through this assignment, I wanted to visualize how someone's personal data could be encrypted.

Describe your design process. Include your numbered list and any other sketches or images that would help us better understand your process.
I started off with gathering my screen time data. I wasn't able to find a way to export the data as a csv or any other table, so I manually wrote down my screen time in minutes. The column is divided by the category of the app I was using, and the rows are divided by days.
On p5.js, I first made a cumulative bar graph. Then I mapped the row data so that it shows the time I spent on each category as a proportion of the total screen time of each day.
I then made a function that could suffle the columns, making it harder for people to actually see how much time I spend on each category.

What did you learn about yourself through the process of self-tracking?
I spend a LOT OF TIME on screen. I figured that I spend almost 12 hours each day on a digital device. Since I extracted data by each categories, I was also able to find where I should spend less time on.

What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization? 
A lot of the data was intentionally lost during my visualization process. Although the actual data is on the top of the script, the visualization encrypted how much time I spent on each category.

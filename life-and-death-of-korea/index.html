          This visualization represents South Korean demographic data from
          February 1998 (when I was born) to December 2024. The pulsing heart
          reflects the rhythm of life and death in my home country - contracting
          with monthly deaths and expanding with births.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart's size changes proportionally to the actual numbers: it
          shrinks with each death and grows with each birth, creating a
          perpetual cycle. The orange progress bar tracks our journey through
          time, moving month by month across 26 years of data.

          This heartbeat-like rhythm reveals a deeper truth about population
          dynamics: like a living organism, a nation's population is in constant
          flux, with each pulse representing thousands of individual stories of
          beginnings and endings. This project visualizes the collective
          heartbeat of my home country's demographic changes.

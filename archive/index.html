      <span class="description">I paired up with Amy to draw an object that we've each lost in the past. Amy lost her umbrella before she moved to New York. This was my very first project using p5.js, and since I had a little experience using html/css/js, I wanted to give myself a little bit of challenge by using 3D primitives. It was a bit more challenging than I expected, but I'm glad I was able to make it work in some scale.</span>

      <span class="description">I got an idea from Tsing's Physical Computing assignment, where she plugged in a ultrasonic sensor on an arduino to make a motor go crazy when someone got really close to it. I tried to make a p5.js version of it, where if you get too close to the face, it starts to turn red, shake and make an alert sound.</span>

      <span class="description">I don't know why thought of this, but I guess it was because I really wanted to drink beer with soju at the time of the ideation process. By the way, soju is usually $1 ~ $1.5 per bottle at a Korean convenience store. The time on the first third indicates the real time, second third is how many bottles of beer are drank and the third is how many bottles of soju are drank. To be honest, I can't drink that much, but this is usually how much three of my friends and I drink together.</span>

      <span class="description">I received 2 sketches from classmates and had to mix it with my own. Yuaning drew a penguin figure, I drew a lego wearing the New School sweatshirt, and Rex drew a character in bitmap style. For my exquisite corpse, I used the head from Yuaning's sketch, body from my lego sketch, and legs from Rex's. In order to make it more interactive, I tried using 3D primitives again. It wasn't easy using default p5.js functions, but I'm glad I was able to make it work.</span>

The class was asked to gather data for 7 days, and after talking with Amy, I found out that I use a lot of time on my devices compared to others. I thought it would be interesting to visualize this, but in a way that is encrypted so nobody knows exactly how much time I spend on each category of apps.</span>
